# API
Just a random API that generates images for various osu things such as user profiles, beatmaps and scores.

**Try it out [here](https://blobnom.herokuapp.com/)**

If you wanna use this yourself even tho it's shit then follow these steps:
- Download the code
- Make a file called `.env` and enter your [osu!api key](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api/) as `OSU_API_KEY`
- Install all the dependencies `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If you're not using heroku, change the port in the `app.py` file to something of your choice
- Run with `python app.py`

If you have any questions or suggestions, open an issue and i'll look into it :D
